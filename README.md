**Turn PS4 `.pkg` files into folders shadPS4 can actually play. On macOS. In one command.**

shadPS4 does not install `.pkg` files anymore. It wants a plain folder containing
`eboot.bin` and `sce_sys/`. `ps4pkg` gets you from one to the other, and names the
folder after the real game so your library is readable.

```
$ ps4pkg extract "EP1063-CUSA13198_00-USOTSUKIHIME0001-A0100-V0100.pkg"

  Package   EP1063-CUSA13198_00-USOTSUKIHIME0001-A0100-V0100.pkg
  Size      1.92 GB
  Type      game
  Into      /Volumes/Games/PS4

  ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀  61%  182/297 files  1.42 GB  ETA 2m 18s
```

...and when it lands:

```
  Game      The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince
  Title ID  CUSA13198
  Folder    /Volumes/Games/PS4/The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince [CUSA13198]
  Took      5m 53s

  ● Ready for shadPS4. Point its game folder at: /Volumes/Games/PS4
```

---

## Install

One line. Paste it into Terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ashref-dev/ps4pkg/main/install.sh | bash
```

That installs what's needed, downloads `ps4pkg`, and builds the extraction engine
(about a minute, once). Then open a new terminal window and you're ready.

**Requirements:** macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and
Apple's command line tools. The installer checks for all three and tells you exactly
what to do if something's missing.

---

## Use it

**One game:**

```bash
ps4pkg extract "MyGame.pkg"
```

**A whole folder of them:**

```bash
cd /Volumes/Games/PS4
ps4pkg batch
```

**See what you've got before committing to anything:**

```bash
ps4pkg check .
```
```
  game     EP1063-CUSA13198_00-USOTSUKIHIME0001-A0100-V0100.pkg
  game     FINAL.FANTASY_CUSA33818_v1.00.pkg
  update   FINAL.FANTASY_CUSA33818_v1.20.pkg
```

**All commands:**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ps4pkg extract <game.pkg> [folder]` | Extract one package. Goes next to the `.pkg` unless you name a folder. |
| `ps4pkg batch [folder]` | Extract every `.pkg` in a folder, one after another. |
| `ps4pkg check [file or folder]` | Is it a game, an update, or DLC? |
| `ps4pkg install` | Build or rebuild the extraction engine. |
| `ps4pkg doctor` | Check that everything is in place. |
| `ps4pkg version` | Version. |

---

## Then in shadPS4

Open shadPS4, go to **Settings → Paths**, and point the game folder at the folder
holding your extracted games. They show up with proper names and cover art.

---

## What it will and won't do to your files

- **Your `.pkg` files are never touched.** Not moved, not deleted, not modified.
- **Nothing is ever overwritten.** Already extracted that game? It says so and stops,
  in under a second, instead of grinding through it again.
- **Ctrl-C is safe.** The half-finished folder is removed, so you never end up with a
  broken game that looks real.
- **A failed extraction leaves nothing behind.** If the engine stops early or reports a
  problem, the partial output is cleaned up rather than presented as a working game.
- **Free space is checked first**, so you don't fill a drive halfway through.

---

## Games, updates and DLC

`ps4pkg` reads what a package actually is and labels the folder to match:

```
The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince [CUSA13198]
FINAL FANTASY [CUSA33818]
FINAL FANTASY [CUSA33818] (Update)
Some Game [CUSA01234] (DLC)
```

A base game folder has `eboot.bin` and is bootable. Updates and DLC are add-on content
and are marked as such, so you always know what you're looking at.

---

## If something goes wrong

**`command not found: ps4pkg`**
Open a new terminal window. If it persists, run `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`.

**Something's missing**
Run `ps4pkg doctor` — it lists what's present and what isn't.

**The build failed**
Usually a missing dependency. Try `brew install cmake zlib` and then `ps4pkg install`.

**"this is not a readable PS4 package"**
The file isn't a real PS4 package, or the download is incomplete or corrupted.
Check the file size against where you got it from.

**Extraction is slow**
Extraction decrypts as it goes, and external drives are the usual bottleneck.
A 2 GB game over USB takes a few minutes; the same game on an internal SSD is far
quicker. The ETA is live, so you always know where you stand.

**It says "Already extracted"**
You've done that one before. Delete the existing folder if you want to redo it.

---

## How it works

The actual extraction is done by `pkg_extractor` from
[AzaharPlus/shadPS4Plus](https://github.com/AzaharPlus/shadPS4Plus) — the PKG handling
code that used to live inside shadPS4 itself, which makes it the most faithful choice
available.

That project publishes Windows and Linux builds only. `ps4pkg` clones it, applies a
small macOS compatibility fix (macOS has no `fseeko64`; its `fseeko` is already
64-bit), builds it against Homebrew's zlib, and wraps it in an interface designed for
humans: live progress, real game names read from `param.sfo`, safe interrupts, and
sensible refusal to destroy anything.

Nothing from that project is redistributed here. It's fetched and built on your machine.

## For AI agents

If you are an AI assistant setting this up for someone, here is the whole job.

**Install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ashref-dev/ps4pkg/main/install.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
ps4pkg doctor
```

`ps4pkg doctor` exits after listing status; every line marked `●` in green is fine.

**Extract:**

```bash
ps4pkg extract "/absolute/path/to/Game.pkg"
```

**Notes that matter when running this non-interactively:**

- Progress is rendered with carriage returns. When capturing output, pipe it through
  `tr '\r' '\n'` or you will see one unreadable line.
- Extraction is genuinely slow on external drives (minutes for multi-GB games). It is
  not hung. Use a generous timeout — 30+ minutes for large titles — and do not kill it
  just because output looks static between file boundaries.
- Exit code is `0` on success, `1` on failure, `130` if interrupted.
- `ps4pkg check <file>` is fast and read-only. Use it to classify packages before
  committing to long extractions.
- Never delete or move the user's `.pkg` files. The tool never does; neither should you.
- The tool refuses to overwrite. If it reports "Already extracted", that is expected
  behaviour and not an error to work around.
- Verify success by confirming `eboot.bin` exists inside the resulting folder. For a
  base game it must be there; for updates and DLC it legitimately is not.

**Do not** attempt to make encrypted or incomplete packages work by patching around
failures. If extraction fails, report it plainly to the user.
